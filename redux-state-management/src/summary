**Core Concepts of Redux :-

(1)Store :- Holds state of your application.

(2)Action :- Describe the changes in the state of application.

(3)Reducer :- Actually carries out the state transition depending on the action.

Example Book Shop

Shop ===========> Shopkeeper ==========> Customer
(Store)            (Reducer)              (action)

**Rules of Redux :-

(1)The state of your application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

{
    NumberofBooks : 10
}

(2)Only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.

{Type:"buyCake"}

(3)To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, we write pure reducer.

**Redux Store:-

(1)getState() method give access to state it holds.

(2)dispatch(action) method alow state to be updated.

(3)It has subscribe(listener) method as well by which we can register listeners.

**React Redux + Hooks

*React Redux offers set of hooks to subscribe to redux store and dispatch actions.

(1)useSelector Hook :-
useSelector is a hook react-redux library provides to get hold of any state that  is maintained in the redux store.


(2)useDispatch() Hook

useDispatch Hook returns a reference to the dispatch function from the Redux Store.
You may use it to dispatch actions as needed.

Syntax - const dispatch = useDispatch()
