(1)simple-state-management => React provides the useState hook, which allows you to add local state to functional components. It returns a state variable and a function to update that state. You can use it to manage simple state within a component.

(2)Context API: The Context API allows you to share state across multiple components without passing props through each level of the component tree. It provides a way to create a context and share the state and functions associated with that context.

(3)Redux: Redux is a popular state management library that provides a centralized store for managing state in your application. It follows a unidirectional data flow and separates the state from the components. Redux is particularly useful for large applications with complex state management needs.
